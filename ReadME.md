- Objective: Create a task management application using the
- MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

# Requirements:

1. ##  Backend (Node.js and Express.js):

- Implement RESTful APIs for task management.
- Create endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks.
- Use MongoDB as the database to store task information.
- Implement data validation and error handling.

2. ## Frontend (React.js):

- Create a user interface for task management.
- Implement a form to add a new task.
- Display a list of tasks with their details (title, description, status, etc.).
- Provide functionality to update the status of a task (e.g., mark as completed).
- Allow users to delete tasks.
- Implement basic styling and layout using CSS.

## Instructions:

1. # Backend Development:

- Set up a Node.js and Express.js project.
- Connect to a MongoDB database using a suitable library or ORM.
- Define the task schema and create the necessary models for CRUD operations.
- Implement the required API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
- Handle validation and error scenarios appropriately.
- Write unit tests for the backend API routes (optional but encouraged).

2. # Frontend Development:

- Set up a React.js project using Create React App or a similar tool.
- Create a form component to add new tasks, including fields for the title, description, and status.
- Build a task list component that displays the tasks retrieved from the backend API.
- Implement functionality to update the status of tasks and delete tasks.
- Apply basic styling to the components using CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap).
- Make API calls to the backend to fetch and update task data.

## Additional Guidelines:

- Follow best practices for code organization, naming conventions, and file structure.
- Use appropriate libraries and frameworks for handling routing, form validation, and state management (e.g., React Router, Formik, Redux).
- Implement error handling and display meaningful error messages to users.
- Pay attention to user experience, making the application intuitive and easy to use.
- Ensure responsiveness and compatibility across different devices and browsers.

## Submission:

- Provide the source code for both the backend and frontend components of the task
management application.
- Deploy the application to a hosting platform (Heroku / Netlify) and provide the live URL.
